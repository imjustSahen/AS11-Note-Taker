## <ins>General info

My task was to build an application that allows a user to write and save notes, while also being able to review past notes. I used Express.js for the back end to allow the user to CREATE, Read, & Delete data from the JSON file. The front end of the application was provided to me for this assignment. 

## <ins>Description

<li>User is able to interact with the deployed application via Heroku</li>
<li>User is able to start taking notes after clicking the Get Started button on the home page</li>
<li>A user can them enter a note title and note body and a Save icon will appear to allow a user to save the note</li>
<li>The user can then view their saved notes and delete any notes after they are accomplished</li>
